# Tech Notes

A concise, Markdown-only knowledge base of my technical notes. It collects concepts, tips, and examples from programming languages and related tech—compiled since the start of my computer science studies. The goal is to stay organized and keep notes up to date over time.

## What this is

- Focused on clarity and quick lookup; no code, no build system
- Files can be read directly on GitHub or any Markdown viewer

## What's inside

## How to browse
- Open files directly on GitHub or in your editor's Markdown preview.
